# Babylon Testing

My work to learn more about Babylon.js, the game engine. I will be using it as the 
game engine for the game I will be building for my senior design project.

I wanted the game to be a 2d game, Babylon is apparently not the best choice for 2d,
so I will be trying another solution.
