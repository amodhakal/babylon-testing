# Babylon Testing

This is my attempt to create a game with Babylon for iOS. I was able to get as far as having a sphere that user can rotate as an iOS app in my phone. I am happy with my progress and the experience of using Babylon.

We are using this technology for our Senior Design for a medicinal game. With my experience, it shouldn't be very difficult building a game with such a wonderful tool.

I'm not sure how well it works on Android, I didn't set the application up for it. Additionally, there are not any starter scripts like a tool like vite does. I might create an installation script for that, setting everything up properly.
